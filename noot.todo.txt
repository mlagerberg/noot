=== TO DO ===

To do list for Noot.


# Tasks

[ ] Cleanup code
    - documentation
    - write tests
[ ] Open source it
[ ] Publish on fdroid


# Tweaks

[v] background color for large black panel on tablet layouts when no file is open
[v] Move overflow menu on To-do entries to the left in tablet mode, because the lines are long
[v] In file list "Remove" should be "Remove from list" to indicate that file is not deleted
[v] Add small headers in file list: Pinned, Files, Folders
[v] App icon is very dark and boring
[v] refresh icon should be yellow, not red


# Features

[ ] Autosave
    - instead of autosaving on exit, as previously implemented, save automatically every x seconds. We have undo/redo now, so it is fine.
[ ] Undo/redo the 'reload from disk' operation.
[ ] Allow more control over text editor per file:
    - syntax highlighting on/off
    - choose markdown/journal/todo format per extension.
[ ] Rich text editor features:
    - Auto-insert curly quotes
    - Show buttons for bold, italic, headers, quotes, tabs, curly quotes, etc.
    ? Auto-convert typing ** or __ to bold and italics
[ ] Search function
    - Add search function to To-do mode
    ~ Improve search UI for text mode
    - Add search to Rich text mode
[v] undo/redo in all modes
    v implement in To-do mode
    v enable somehow in text mode
    v flip _enableUndoRedo in markdown mode
    v buttons should be in appbar, not as extra bar above editor
[ ] Consider supporting nested folders in the sidebar


# Replacing Code editor considerations

[ ] Pros:
    - Slow, even with markdown syntax disabled
    - Undo/redo does not work properly, e.g. typing newlines is not detected as an edit action
    - Undo/redo does not show size of stack (determines if buttons should be enabled or not)
    - Would be nice to be able to toggle word wrap on and off
[ ] Cons:
    - We have a (sort of) syntax highlighting done for To-do format
    - Not sure if there are other viable options.
[ ] Alternatives:
    x code_editor: ^2.1.0 -> by default shows a highlighter and edit mode separately. Editor comes with a lot of fluff around it.
    - web-based?


# Bugs

[ ] super-editor saves tab indents as 2 spaces. Serializing a deserialized file without editing it, changes the file.
[ ] super-editor can't insert a single linebreak (always creates new paragraph).
[ ] Custom syntax highlighter is incomplete. Parent tasks don't influence their kids.
[v] After creating a file, it doesn't open automatically because permissions are not granted.
[x] Android desktop mode or windowed mode, has the captionBar overlap with the appbar
    - not sure if fixable without changes by Flutter:
    - https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/default-systemuimode-edge-to-edge
    - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/150374
    v tried it, still doesn't work


# Code improvements

[ ] Use a provider for the FileManager (`master_detail_container.dart:48`)
[ ] `start_screen`  contains magic strings to communicate with `MainActivity.kt`
[ ] Many magic strings in `file_io_manager.dart`
[ ] Saving and restoring selection in the rich text editor requires storing node ID and more
[ ] Swipe gesture in To-do editor could be improved so the animation does not flip back too soon
[ ] Deleting the last entry inserts a blank new one, which adds another action in the undo stack.
[ ] Use proper routing to prevent issues with accessing context across sync gaps
    - Consider GetX
    - Or make a simple navigator service (https://medium.com/flutter-community/navigate-without-context-in-flutter-with-a-navigation-service-e6d76e880c1c)
